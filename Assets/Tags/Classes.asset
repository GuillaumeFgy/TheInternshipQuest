  - "Nice try, but we\u2019re still going druid."
  - You can click all you want.
  - "That\u2019s adorable. But, no."
  - "I see you\u2019re determined. Unfortunately, so am I."
  - Not gonna happen, sorry.
  - Oh wow, another click. Groundbreaking.
  - This button is basically decorative.
  - "At this point, you\u2019re just testing my patience."
  - "The definition of insanity is\u2026 well, this."
  - Still no. Thanks for asking, though
  - You think I coded other classes?
  - "Look, I\u2019m the dev. I make the rules. And the rule is: druid."
  - The button sighs, but says nothing.
  - "This isn\u2019t character creation. It\u2019s character revelation."
  - "Pro tip: the button doesn\u2019t actually do anything."
  - Still trying? I respect the grind.
  - "Okay fine, you unlocked\u2026 disappointment."
  - "You\u2019ve clicked enough to summon\u2026 nothing."
  - "I\u2019m starting to think you don\u2019t trust me."
  - "Consistency is key, even if it\u2019s clicking this."
  - "You\u2019ve got good form\u2014clean, decisive clicking."
  - "The button nods approvingly. You\u2019re doing great!"
  - "Some say you\u2019re wasting time. I say you\u2019re making memories."
  - "You\u2019re the hero this button didn\u2019t know it needed."
  - "You keep this up and we\u2019ll have to name the button."
  - That one felt extra clicky. Nice touch.
  - "It\u2019s official: you\u2019re this button\u2019s favorite human."
  - Alright, this button is officially tired.
